Technical specifications:

A service for receiving and storing data from sensors. 
The following features have been implemented:
– The service, having received data from a sensor, enters it into the database, checks for validity and whether such a sensor is registered. If all data are valid and the sensor is registered, it enters the data into the corresponding database. 
– If the sensor is not registered, it returns an error or registers a new sensor, depending on the settings set by the service owner.
